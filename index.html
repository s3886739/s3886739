<p>My name is Mohamad Abdallah, my student number is S3886739. I am of Lebanese origin, moved here 5 years ago without my parents to complete school and get into university.  I was a second year Bachelor of Project Management Student at RMIT. I also work at Optus as a part timer while I’m studying. Throughout working at Optus, and using a range of different softwares and databases, I have gotten a real grasp on how the corporate and the business world run. After working at the company and doing other work over the past 2 years for other construction businesses, I came to a number of realisations.</p>

<p>One of the realisations was, how powerful, vital and important Information Technology has on the progress and survival of companies and organisations. It seemed like everything depended on some sort of system or database to work, one error can lead to losing a large sum of money and valuable time! This showed me how vital it was to gain Information Technology experience and leverage that in the business/ corporate world.</p>

<p>Another realisation was that IT is going to last and keep developing forever. This means that there will always be a demand for innovative and experienced people in the domain. Driving the change or the development in a specific niche or sector that can potentially lead to certain organisations making or saving more money will lead to very rewarding prizes. This type of challenge intrigues me and drives me, especially on the days that discipline is needed the most to get the job done. These are the main points that have driven me towards this course and IT. </p>

<p>My passion for the construction industry is still there, however, my thinking and innovation has led me to pursue learning more about Information Technology to try and combine the 2 worlds together and try and change the construction industry and the way we build our houses and live our lives. </p>

<p>My main expectation of this course is to teach me how to code different operating systems, manage and optimise databases in order for me to combine information technology and infuse it into our daily lives. This would be done via integrating robots and computers into our homes to become part of our daily routine and help with simple everyday tasks that would save us time, help us consume energy more effectively, etc… </p>

<h2>Traits</h2>

<p>My test results indicate that I am driven to create my own empire and that I do not normally submit to taking orders from a more powerful figure. I tend to look and analyse data differently than others around me, especially if it is graphed out and mapped. Having results physically in front of me would also play a huge role in my success. For this matter I would like to think that I would normally be the team leader, or at least become the team leader in such a short period of time. This would push me to behave in a more independent and unorthodox way and would sometimes get me into conflict with other team members. Some key points that need to be taken into account when forming a team would be identifying individuals that like to think outside the box. Another attribute of the members would be their desire to communicate with others and build relationships inside and outside the team to help get the work done. Team members have to also accept that they need to be told what to do and get the job done as a team cannot function having several 90% of members fighting for the leader position. </p>

<h2>Ideal Job:</h2>

<p>My ideal job in IT would be founding and owning my Home Automation business that uses my own code, programming and data integration system to create a more effective and cheap alternative to the other basic home automation systems out there. This is particularly appealing to me as it suits my personality and my ambitions to become an entrepreneur. The second reason why this job is appealing to me is that this job will help me become a key player in solving many problems that we have in our lives that cause us a lot of stress. The job will allow me to help others be able to take a step back from having to worry about the small little tasks everyday, focus on the real challenges in life and help us appreciate life and live every minute of everyday stress free. </p>

<p>For me to be able to launch and successfully manage and scale this business I would need a set of skills. These skills include: </p>

<li>Advanced knowledge in setting up and programming an SQL database. </li>
<li>Advanced skills in building a website for the business (marketing purposes).</li>
<li>Be able to work with other businesses. </li>
<li>Advanced marketing skills.</li>
<li>Advanced sales skills. </li>
<li>Managing and motivating my team.</li>
<li>Picking the right team. </li>
<li>Mentor my team.</li>

<p>I already have a few of these skills that are required for me to build and run the business. Some of these skills that I have need to be advanced and developed further. The first skill that I confidently possess is sales and marketing as I have worked in a sales environment and I have mastered this skill and gained national recognition for my results in the company that I work for. I also have experience managing, motivating, mentoring and picking the right individuals for the job as I have had experience leading and managing a sales team.</p>

<p>Other skills like advanced coding, programming, database and SQL programming still need to be gained and worked on. I aim to work on these skills and develop them so that they are a key factor in my success and the success of the business. </p>

<p>I aim to improve my skills by completing this university course and getting my bachelors of Information Technology. The other path I need to take to advance these skills that I gain from my course is getting a job in the IT field where I am programming different software and hardware. This will allow me to gain more knowledge not only how to advance my programming and coding skills,but also how these businesses run and conduct business. As to my marketing skills, I aim to develop those by running marketing campaigns for small mock e-commerce businesses that I start up. This would be done so i can develop and gain the basics of marketing and how to grab people’s attention and then apply it to my main business, MySmartHome.</p>


<h2>Project: </h2>

<h3>Overview: </h3>

<p>Smart home automation is the concept I have decided to research and pursue for the purpose of this assignment. This project is about a system that programs certain gadgets and facilities in the house to turn on/off based on other actions that it would be programmed to detect. An example of this is when you wake up in the morning, if the sensors in the bedroom detect motion between a set time-frame it lights up the way to the bathroom for you to have a shower and turns the coffee on 10 minutes after. </p>

<h3>Motivation: </h3>

<p>We live such a fast paced and time-rushed life. Imagine waking up in the morning and as soon as your smart home detects that you are awake, it sends out an order to all the different facilities in the house to operate. These small tasks that frustrate us and make us fall back in time when leaving the house can happen automatically every morning. This saves us time, improves our mental health and allows us to use energy more effectively in certain areas of our lives. I am also motivated to achieve this project as it improves the value and worth of the real-estate that we reside in, tying back to my key personality trait as an entrepreneur. </p>

<h3>Description:</h3>

<p>This project will as mentioned before revolutionise our daily routines, improve our mental health and make life easier in general. The way we start and plan our day. Instead of the individual worrying about the small silly tasks everyday all these tasks could happen automatically and simultaneously. Other home automation systems like amazon google’s still have limited use of connecting cameras and door locks.</p>

<p>
This project will automate the whole house, every facility such as the lights, coffee machines and much more can be programmed to activate as you decide. A perfect example of a programmable automated day would be the sensors detecting motion in the morning between 5 and 6 am from monday to friday. Once that is detected, the small lights that lead to the bathroom would light up leading to the bathroom and the wardrobe. The individual would then have a shower and change clothes. By the time the individual is done with this activity (15 mins after) the coffee machine would have already prepared your coffee and the kitchen lights would activate. The system can also be programmed to turn on the lights in the children’s room and open the curtains. </p>

<p>This removes the stress out of running around the house and rushing through the tasks that overwhelm us every morning. The system would also be able to detect trends and recommend them to be part of the activation process. Tasks like opening up the curtains in the morning would be recommended if the system detects that they are always opened at a certain time over a consecutive week.</p>

<p>
The system would also be able to detect your proximity based on the geographic location on your phone. The system can be programmed to unlock the door, turn the oven on to cook dinner. </p>

<p>This system not only would have a huge impact on our lives and mental health, but it will also be a huge avenue towards building a more energy sustainable future. The system aims to do that by getting the user to only utilise energy as much as needed. Instead of turning the switch on for the whole room, the system would only use spot lights to light up the pathway to the bathroom, and turn off all unneeded devices when every member of the family has left the geographical zone. </p>

<p>The system’s ability to detect trends and task compatibility would require an advanced level of coding and programming using a range of different software and programs that are to be discussed later. Contracting technicians are also required to install the facilities in the house for the project to be successful. </p>

<h3>Tools and Technologies: </h3>

<p>
For this project to be successful a number of hardware, software and tools are needed. This includes: </p>

<li>My SQL database</li>
<li>Motion detecting sensors </li>
<li>Smart adapters </li>
<li>Computer</li>
<li>Internet connection</li>
<li>Handyman contractor </li>

<h3>Skills Required: </h3>

<p>This project would require a set of skills that need to be implemented for it to be successful. The first skill that would be required to build this project would be coding and programming. We need to program the different actions and the requirements for the actions to activate. The second skill that would be needed is my sql programming as we would need to create a database and link each action to the different variables. This would also help us determine the trends in actions within certain times. We would also need labouring skills to install the different equipment that need to function for the project to be successful. </p>

<h3>Outcome: </h3>

<p>For the project to be successful, it would need to run smoothly and play a key role in improving the quality of our lives, help us improve our mornings and set us up for a more enjoyable day. The project would also need to make such a huge impact that it starts getting implemented by huge construction companies all over the world so that it makes a significant effect on sustainable energy consumption. The project would need to make that huge impact on our lives that it dramatically scales up the value of the property. </p>
